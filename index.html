            <!-- About Me / My Journey will go here -->
             <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m Shauna, currently working as a Technical Support Specialist at Intercom. My day-to-day revolves around problem-solving, guiding customers through techincal challenges, and keeping things running smoothly behind the scenes. Outside of work, I’m a big believer in continuous learning — whether it’s through professional development, personal projects, or just diving down the occasional rabbit hole of curiosity. When I’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find me enjoying a coffee, exploring new places, or keeping active through running and fitness.</p>
             <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>My interest in coding started as a curiosity — wanting to understand how some tools and platforms worked as well as wanting the ability to be able to build something from scratch. I begun by exploring Git/Github & HTML - moving onto CSS, JavaScript & more. I did original start previously  through free online tutorials, but now hitting the more structured courses.
                I’ve been lucky to have the opportunity to explore this development as part of my current role through a technical pathway, as well as through observing my engineering colleagues on the Hack Nights. Outside of work, I’ve been pushing myself with personal projects to challenge my knowledge from currently simple websites to potentially interactive apps, with the hopes that each one helps me grow as a developer.
                This journey is just getting started, but I’m committed to building the skills that will take me from enthusiastic beginner to confident, job-ready developer.</p>

                <h3>Daily Coding Logs</h3>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong>In Progress | <strong>Year:</strong>2025</p>
                <p>My Coding Journal is a personal learning repository that combines daily coding reflections with a curated collection of useful code snippets. Each day, I document what I've learned, challenges I've faced, and goals for tomorrow in structured markdown logs. Alongside these entries, I build a searchable library of code snippets organized by language and topic. This dual approach serves as both a learning accountability system and a practical reference tool, while simultaneously providing daily practice with Git workflows including branching, merging, and version control fundamentals.</p>

                <p>A clean, professional portfolio website designed to highlight my coding skills and project experience. Built with semantic HTML and structured to be easily maintainable and scalable as I continue learning new technologies.</p>
                <p>Goal: As I learn and develop my skills/languages, the website will develop and grow - this is where I will put my knowledge to the test.</p>
